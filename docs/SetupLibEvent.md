Download libevent-2.0.21-stable @ https://github.com/downloads/libevent/libevent/libevent-2.0.21-stable.tar.gz<br>

```
cd ~/Downloads/libevent-2.0.21-stable
./configure
sudo make install
```

If that didn't work, consult the Libevent website :/

A hint for Mac users, you'll need XCode installed + command-line support.
